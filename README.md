# Skeleton v2

Skeleton v2 is an easy platformer game where the goal is to reach the end of each level while collecting all the available coins and avoiding enemies along the way.

## How to Play
- Use the **A** key to move left.
- Use the **D** key to move right.
- Press the **SPACE** key to jump over obstacles and enemies.

Your objective is to navigate through the level, carefully timing your jumps to avoid falling into pits or colliding with enemies. Collect all the coins scattered throughout the level to earn points and complete the level successfully.

One important mechanic in Skeleton v2 is the ability to defeat enemies by jumping on their heads. When you jump on top of an enemy, it will be defeated. However, be careful not to touch the enemies from the sides or below, as doing so will cause you to lose a life.
